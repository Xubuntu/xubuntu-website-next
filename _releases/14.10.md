In Xubuntu 14.10, only a few new features were included; a new Power management applet was added to the panel and the window cycling dialog allowed items to be focused with a mouseclick. Users of Xubuntu 14.10 saw the inclusion of pink highlights, highlighting the ease with which changes can be made to the desktop by users if they didn't get on with the default.

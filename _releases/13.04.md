Xubuntu 13.04 was intended as a maintenance release with few new features. Updates to documentation were included with new versions of Catfish and Parole. GIMP and Gnumeric were reintroduced after a decision to set the target size to 1GB. From Xubuntu 13.04, regular releases would be supported for only 9 months.

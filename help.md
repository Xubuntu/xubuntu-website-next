            <p>Due to the real-time nature of IRC, it is often the fastest way to get help.</p>
            <p><em>Please be patient: while there may appear to be lots of people in the channel, they may not be available at the time. While you are waiting, it is a good idea to look for an answer via other support methods.</em></p>

            <p>Additional help can be found in the <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/IRC/ChannelList#IRC.2FChannelList.2FLocal.Local_Ubuntu_channels">localized Ubuntu IRC channels</a>, for those who prefer to chat in their native language, as well as the official <a href="https://web.libera.chat/?nick=xu-help?w#xfce">#xfce</a> community support.</p>
            <p>If you prefer a desktop application to use IRC, then you can use the pre-installed Pidgin instant messenger or your favorite IRC client to join the channels on the Libera Chat IRC network (irc.libera.chat).</p>

The Xubuntu team is happy to announce the immediate release of Xubuntu 19.04!

Xubuntu 19.04 is a regular release and will be supported for 9 months, until January 2020. If you need a stable environment with longer support time, we recommend that you use [Xubuntu 18.04 LTS](https://xubuntu.org/release/18-04/) instead.

The **final release images** are available as torrents and direct downloads from [xubuntu.org/getxubuntu/](https://xubuntu.org/getxubuntu/)

As the main server might be busy in the first few days after the release, we recommend using the torrents if possible.

We’d like to thank everybody who contributed to this release of Xubuntu!

Highlights and Known Issues
---------------------------

### Highlights

- Xubuntu 19.04 features a wide range of bug fixes for issues identified in previous releases, many of which have already been backported to the stable releases.
- AptURL, The GIMP, and LibreOffice Impress have been included to provide a more complete and user-friendly desktop experience.
- New keyboard shortcuts make it easier and faster to get work done. **Shift + Print Screen** will capture a screenshot for a specified region. Press **F4** in Thunar to open a terminal window in the current path, or press **Ctrl + Shift + F** to search for files.
- Many Xfce 4.13 components have been added or updated, providing an updated snapshot of Xfce 4.14 development.

### Known Issues

- If more than one instance of the Xfce Pulseaudio Plugin is added to the panel, volume notifications will be duplicated.
- Tooltips can become unresponsive in the Xfce Task Manager. Usually a bit of movement will cause the tooltip to fade away.

For more obscure known issues, information on affecting bugs, bug fixes, and a list of new package versions, please refer to the [Xubuntu Release Notes](http://wiki.xubuntu.org/releases/19.04/release-notes).

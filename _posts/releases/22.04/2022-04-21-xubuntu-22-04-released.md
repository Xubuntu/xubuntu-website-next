The Xubuntu team is happy to announce the immediate release of Xubuntu 22.04.

Xubuntu 22.04, codenamed **Jammy Jellyfish**, is a long-term support (LTS) release and will be supported for 3 years, until 2025.

The Xubuntu and Xfce development teams have made great strides in usability, expanded features, and additional applications in the last two years. Users coming from 20.04 will be delighted with improvements found in Xfce 4.16 and our expanded application set. 21.10 users will appreciate the added stability that comes from the numerous maintenance releases that landed this cycle.

The **final release images** are available as torrents and direct downloads from [xubuntu.org/download/](https://xubuntu.org/download/).

As the main server might be busy in the first few days after the release, we recommend using the torrents if possible.

**Xubuntu Core**, our minimal ISO edition, is available to download from [unit193.net/xubuntu/core/](https://unit193.net/xubuntu/core/) \[[torrent](http://unit193.net/xubuntu/core/xubuntu-22.04-core-amd64.iso.torrent)\]. Find out more about Xubuntu Core [here](https://unit193.net/xubuntu/).

Weâ€™d like to thank everybody who contributed to this release of Xubuntu!

Highlights and Known Issues
---------------------------

### Highlights

- **Mousepad 0.5.8**, our text editor, broadens its feature set with the addition of session backup and restore, plugin support, and a new gspell plugin.
- **Ristretto 0.12.2**, the versatile image viewer, improves thumbnail support and features numerous performance improvements.
- **Whisker Menu Plugin 2.7.1** expands customization options with several new preferences and CSS classes for theme developers.
- **Firefox** is now included as a Snap package.
- Refreshed [user documentation](https://xubuntu.github.io/xubuntu-docs/user/C/index.html), available on the ISO and online.
- Six new wallpapers from the [22.04 Community Wallpaper Contest](https://xubuntu.org/news/xubuntu-22-04-community-wallpaper-contest-winners/).

### Known Issues

- The shutdown prompt may not be displayed at the end of the installation. Instead you might just see a Xubuntu logo, a black screen with an underscore in the upper left hand corner, or just a black screen. Press Enter and the system will reboot into the installed environment. (LP: [\#1944519](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu-release-notes/+bug/1944519))
- The Firefox Snap is not currently able to open the locally-installed Xubuntu Docs. (LP: [\#1967109](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/firefox/+bug/1967109))

The Xubuntu team is happy to announce the results of the 22.04 community wallpaper contest!

As always, we'd like to send out a huge thanks to every contestant. The Xubuntu Community Wallpaper Contest gives us a unique chance to interact with the community and get contributions from members who may otherwise not have had the opportunity to join in before. With around 130 submissions, the contest garnered less interest this time around, but we still had a lot of great work to pick from. All of the submissions are browsable on the [22.04 contest page at contest.xubuntu.org](https://contest.xubuntu.org/wallpaper_contest/xubuntu-22-04-community-wallpaper-contest/?action=view).

Without further ado, here are the winners:

The Xubuntu team is happy to announce the immediate release of Xubuntu 18.04. Xubuntu 18.04 is a long-term support (LTS) release and will be supported for 3 years, until April 2021.

The **final release images** are available as torrents and direct downloads immediately from [xubuntu.org/getxubuntu/](https://xubuntu.org/getxubuntu/). As the main server and mirrors might be busy for the first few days after the release, we recommend using the torrents if possible.

**Xubuntu Core**, our minimal installation option, is available to download from [unit193.net/xubuntu/core/](https://unit193.net/xubuntu/core/) \[[64-bit magnet](magnet:?xt=urn:btih:7728679d017e596021153147e80bceff2062445f&dn=xubuntu-18.04-core-amd64.iso&tr=udp%3a%2f%2ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3a6969&tr=udp%3a%2f%2ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3a6969&tr=udp%3a%2f%2feddie4.nl%3a6969&tr=udp%3a%2f%2ftracker.pirateparty.gr%3a6969&tr=udp%3a%2f%2fopentrackr.org%3a1337&tr=udp%3a%2f%2ftracker.zer0day.to%3a1337), [32-bit magnet](magnet:?xt=urn:btih:997ddaa25ea5559188427dc75e310718d2637787&dn=xubuntu-18.04-core-i386.iso&tr=udp%3a%2f%2ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3a6969&tr=udp%3a%2f%2ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3a6969&tr=udp%3a%2f%2feddie4.nl%3a6969&tr=udp%3a%2f%2ftracker.pirateparty.gr%3a6969&tr=udp%3a%2f%2fopentrackr.org%3a1337&tr=udp%3a%2f%2ftracker.zer0day.to%3a1337)\].

Highlights and Known Issues
---------------------------

The below is just a quick peek at the most important highlights and issues. More updates and new features are listed on the very thorough [release notes](https://wiki.xubuntu.org/releases/18.04/release-notes).

### Highlights

- Some GNOME applications are replaced with corresponding MATE applications for improved consistency with almost identical set of features
- The Sound Indicator plugin is replaced with the Xfce PulseAudio plugin in the panel, improving controlling the volume and multimedia applications from the panel
- The new xfce4-notifyd panel plugin is included, allowing you to easily toggle "Do Not Disturb" mode for notifications as well as view missed notifications
- Significantly improved menu editing with a new MenuLibre version
- Better support for HiDPI screens, better consistency and other improvements from the Greybird GTK+ theme

### Known Issues

- The "Force UEFI installation" dialog has non-working Go Back/Continue buttons ([1724482](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/ubiquity/+bug/1724482)).
- The automatically selected keyboard layout does not necessarily match the chosen region ([1706859](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/ubiquity/+bug/1706859)).

As always, check [Launchpad](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/) for bugs related to your hardware to make sure there aren't any critical bugs that could potentially make your system unbootable or otherwise unusable.

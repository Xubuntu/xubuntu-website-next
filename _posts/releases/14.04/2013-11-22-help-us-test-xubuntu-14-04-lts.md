In less than 6 months time we will release Xubuntu 14.04 Trusty Tahr, a long-term release which will be supported for 3 years. Even if you have never dabbled in testing â€“ now is the time to have a go!

How can I help?
---------------

Testing Xubuntu is an important step on the way to the release of a stable operating system. With proper and reported testing we are able to find out the bugs and issues and iron them out before the final release.

You can find a basic overview of how testing is set up at the Ubuntu QA [wiki](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/QATeam/Roles/Tester), but do bear in mind that our requirements are more specific and some of that page is aimed at Ubuntu testing.

We have two different areas of testing, which vary in depth and length. This makes it easy to find a test suitable for your schedule and skills, but remember: **only reported tests count!** You can help us with testing either

- daily images, in the [ISO QA tracker](http://iso.qa.ubuntu.com/); or
- packages included in Xubuntu, in the [packages QA tracker](http://packages.qa.ubuntu.com/)

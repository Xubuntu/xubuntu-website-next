The Xubuntu team is happy to announce the immediate release of Xubuntu 14.04 Alpha 2!

As often expected with very early cycle releases, this release has some issues which we will be working to resolve before the final release.

Notably, it is impossible to successfully use the Alpha 2 to set up an auto-resized system automatically. You will not be able to set the partition sizes.

Thanks to the 12 who tested *and* reported to the tracker for Alpha 2:

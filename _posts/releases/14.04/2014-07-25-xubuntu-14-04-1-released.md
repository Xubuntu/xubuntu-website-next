- Sorting by date or name not working correctly in Ristretto ([1270894](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/ristretto/+bug/1270894))
- Due to the switch from xscreensaver to light-locker, some users might have issues with timing of locking; removing xscreensaver from the system should fix these problems

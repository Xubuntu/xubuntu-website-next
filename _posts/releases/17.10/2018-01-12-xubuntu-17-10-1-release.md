Following the recent testing of a respin to deal with the [BIOS](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/1734147) bug on some Lenovo machines, Xubuntu 17.10.1 has been released. Official download sources have been updated to point to this point release, but if you're using a mirror, be sure you are downloading the 17.10**.1** version.

No changes to applications are included, however, this release does include any updates made between the original release date and now.

Note: Even with this fix, you will want to update your system to make sure you get all security fixes since the ISO respin, including the one for Meltdown, addressed in [USN-3523](https://usn.ubuntu.com/usn/usn-3523-1/), which you can read more about [here](https://insights.ubuntu.com/2018/01/12/meltdown-and-spectre-status-update/).

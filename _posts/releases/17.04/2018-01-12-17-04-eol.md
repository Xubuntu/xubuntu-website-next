On Saturday 13th January 2018, Xubuntu 17.04 goes End of Life (EOL). For more information please see the [Ubuntu 17.04 EOL Notice](https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-announce/2018-January/000227.html).

We **strongly recommend** upgrading to the current regular release, Xubuntu 17.10.1, as soon as practical. Alternatively you can [download the current Xubuntu release](https://xubuntu.org/download) and install fresh.

The 17.10.1 release recently saw testing across all flavors to address the [BIOS bug](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/1734147) found after its release in October 2017. Updated and bugfree ISO files are now available.

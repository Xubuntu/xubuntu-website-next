The Xubuntu team is glad to announce the release of Xubuntu Saucy Salamander Beta 2! Please note that this beta is not suited for production machines. Always back up your data before upgrading.

With this beta, we hope to have most of our important features ready as well as most of the critical bugs fixed. The team has worked hard triaging and fixing bugs and we are happy to have been able to ship fixes for many bugs.

Some of the highlights for the Saucy Salamander beta 2 include:

- A new version of xfce4-settings has been uploaded bringing amongst other things a new dialog to set up your displays
- A tool for changing your theme colors easily, gtk-theme-config, has been added to the default installation
- New wallpaper
- New releases of our Gtk themes (with Gtk3.10 support) as well as the LightDM greeter, fixing many visual bugs
- Updated documentation

The release notes along with full list of new features and known issues can be found at <https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SaucySalamander/Beta2/Xubuntu>.

We want to send thanks to all of our contributors, especially those who helped make the Beta 2 testing cover much more ground than Beta 1. Keep up the good work! The development status along with a full list of work tasks done by the team and other contributors, including many tasks not directly visible to our end-users, can be found at <http://status.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-s/group/topic-s-flavor-xubuntu.html>.

To report a bug, please let the automatic reporting process work its way through. For when that doesnâ€™t happen, please run `ubuntu-bug` followed by the package name to make a report. For example, to file suggestions for improving our offline documentation, please run `ubuntu-bug xubuntu-docs` from the command line.

The final release of Xubuntu 13.10 is set for October 17, 2013.

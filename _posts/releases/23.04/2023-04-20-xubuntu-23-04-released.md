The Xubuntu team is happy to announce the immediate release of Xubuntu 23.04.

Xubuntu 23.04, codenamed **Lunar Lobster**, is a regular release and will be supported for 9 months, until January 2024.

Xubuntu 23.04, featuring the latest updates from Xfce 4.18 and GNOME 44.

Xubuntu 23.04 features the latest Xfce 4.18. Xfce 4.18 delivers a stable desktop environment with a number of performance improvements and new features to enjoy. In particular, the Thunar file manager benefits from a new image preview feature, undo and redo functionality, file highlights, and recursive search. Check out the [Xfce 4.18](https://www.xfce.org/about/tour418) tour for more details!

Xubuntu 23.04 also welcomes **Xubuntu Minimal** as an official subproject. Xubuntu Minimal is a slimmed down version of Xubuntu that only includes the bare essentials: the desktop, a few Xfce components, and the Xubuntu look and feel. Longtime Xubuntu fans may better know this as *[Xubuntu Core](https://xubuntu.org/news/introducing-xubuntu-core/)*. After nearly eight years of being a supported, but community-built project, we're happy to finally publish downloads along with the main Xubuntu version. Many thanks to the community for keeping the dream alive all these years!

The **final release images** are available as torrents and direct downloads from [xubuntu.org/download/](https://xubuntu.org/download/).

As the main server might be busy in the first few days after the release, we recommend using the torrents if possible.

Weâ€™d like to thank everybody who contributed to this release of Xubuntu!

Highlights and Known Issues
---------------------------

### Highlights

- **Xfce 4.18**, released in December 2022, is included in Xubuntu 23.04.
- **Xubuntu Minimal** is included as an officially supported subproject.
- **Pipewire** (and wireplumber) are now included in Xubuntu.

### Known Issues

- The shutdown prompt may not be displayed at the end of the installation. Instead you might just see a Xubuntu logo, a black screen with an underscore in the upper left hand corner, or just a black screen. Press Enter and the system will reboot into the installed environment. (LP: [\#1944519](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu-release-notes/+bug/1944519))
- The screensaver unlock dialog crashes after unlocking. The session can still be locked and unlocked after this crash. We're working on a fix and hope to publish it in the next few weeks. (LP: #[2012795](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/xfce4-screensaver/+bug/2012795))
- Xorg crashes and the user is logged out after logging in or switching users on some virtual machines, including GNOME Boxes. (LP: #[1861609](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/xorg-server/+bug/1861609))

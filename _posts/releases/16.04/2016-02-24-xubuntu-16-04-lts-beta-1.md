The Xubuntu team is pleased to announce the immediate release of Xubuntu 16.04 LTS Beta 1. This is the first beta towards the final release in April.

The first beta release also marks the end of the period to land new features in the form of Ubuntu Feature Freeze. This means any new updates to packages should be bug fixes only, the Xubuntu team is committed to fixing as many of the bugs as possible before the final release.

**Please note! No upgrade testing was undertaken during this milestone. There are issues currently when upgrading to Xenial Xerus. This release is not suitable for upgrading.**

**The Beta 1 release is available for download by torrents and direct downloads from**[ http://cdimages.ubuntu.com/xubuntu/releases/xenial/beta-1/](http://cdimages.ubuntu.com/xubuntu/releases/xenial/beta-1/)

Changes for 16.04

- Xubuntu 16.04 will not have a default media manager installed; this is already reflected in the Beta 1 images.

Known Issues

In addition to the above media manager change not being reflected in the documentation, several places still refer to 15.10 instead of 16.04, including the installer slideshow. The affected packages will be updated for Beta 2.

Some issues during testing of image were found, in addition some bugs related to Xubuntu have been noted during the development cycle. Full detail of all of these can be found in the release notes at <https://wiki.ubuntu.com/XenialXerus/Beta1/Xubuntu>

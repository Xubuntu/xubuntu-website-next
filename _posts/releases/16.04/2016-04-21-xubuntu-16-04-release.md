The Xubuntu team is pleased to announce the immediate release of Xubuntu 16.04. Xubuntu 16.04 is an LTS (Long-Term Support) release and will be supported for 3 years.

The **final release images** are available as Torrents and direct downloads from <http://xubuntu.org/getxubuntu/>

As the main server will be very busy in the first few days after release, we recommend using the Torrents wherever possible.

Highlights and Known Issues
---------------------------

### Highlights

- [New community wallpapers](/news/xubuntu-16-04-wallpaper-competition-winners/)
- Ubuntu Software Centre replaced by GNOME Software

### Known Issues

- Thunar is the subject of a few bugs, though they all appear to revolve around similar issues. We have 2 patches applied that, while not completely fixing the issue, do lessen the impact.
- When returning from lock, the cursor disappears on the desktop, you can bring the cursor back with *Ctrl+Alt+F1* followed by *Ctrl+Alt+F7*
- Mugshot crashes when capturing image with camera. Camera currently disabled.
- Albatross, Bluebird and Orion GTK+ themes have been dropped since they do not support newer GTK3 versions

For more information on affecting bugs, bug fixes and a list of new package versions (since 14.04 LTS), please refer to the [Release Notes](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/XenialXerus/FinalRelease/Xubuntu "Xubuntu 16.04 Release Notes").

Thanks to all who have contributed to Xubuntu, not least those who test for us when called upon, and generally *anyone* can do that for us all. We will name you all in time – you deserve one last mention. Thank you on behalf of all installing Xubuntu – you all rock!

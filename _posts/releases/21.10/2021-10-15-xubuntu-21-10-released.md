The Xubuntu team is happy to announce the immediate release of Xubuntu 21.10.

Xubuntu 21.10, codenamed **Impish Indri**, is a regular release and will be supported for 9 months, until June 2022. If you need a stable environment with longer support time we recommend that you use [Xubuntu 20.04 LTS](https://xubuntu.org/release/20-04/) instead.

The **final release images** are available as torrents and direct downloads from [xubuntu.org/download/](https://xubuntu.org/download/).

As the main server might be busy in the first few days after the release, we recommend using the torrents if possible.

**Xubuntu Core**, our minimal ISO edition, is available to download from [unit193.net/xubuntu/core/](https://unit193.net/xubuntu/core/) \[[torrent](http://unit193.net/xubuntu/core/xubuntu-21.10-core-amd64.iso.torrent)\]. Find out more about Xubuntu Core [here](https://unit193.net/xubuntu/).

We'd like to thank everybody who contributed to this release of Xubuntu!

Highlights and Known Issues
---------------------------

### Highlights

- **New Software:** Xubuntu now comes pre-installed with GNOME Disk Analyzer, GNOME Disk Utility, and Rhythmbox. Disk Analyzer and Disk Utility make it easier to monitor and manage your partitions. Rhythmbox enables music playback with a dedicated media library.
- **Pipewire:** Pipewire is now included in Xubuntu, and is used in conjunction with PulseAudio to improve audio playback and hardware support in Linux.
- **Keyboard Shortcuts:** The Super (Windows) key will now reveal the applications menu. Existing Super+ keyboard shortcuts are unaffected.

### Known Issues

- The shutdown prompt may not be displayed at the end of the installation. Instead you might just see a Xubuntu logo, a black screen with an underscore in the upper left hand corner, or just a black screen. Press Enter and the system will reboot into the installed environment. (LP: [\#1944519](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu-release-notes/+bug/1944519))

The Xubuntu team is glad to announce the immediate release of Xubuntu 13.04 Beta 2!

**Note:** Starting from 13.04, the Xubuntu images will not fit on standard CDs any more. This affects the Beta 2 images as well. To install Xubuntu you will need other media such as a USB device or a DVD. The Xubuntu 13.04 Beta 2 image size is approximately 800 MB.

Xubuntu 13.04 is mostly a maintenance release, and there won't be too many new features. In Beta 2, we've fixed the following bugs:

- Documentation is updated to 13.04
- New version of Catfish (0.6.1) is included and fixes a lot of bugs
- More updates for the Greybird theme

In addition, new features and bug fixes introduced in Beta 1 and earlier include:

- Gnumeric and GIMP are reintroduced
- New version of Parole (0.5.0) is included
- Duplicate partitions are no longer shown on desktop or Thunar
- Some updates for the Greybird theme

The Xubuntu team is glad to announce the immediate release of Xubuntu 13.04 Beta 1!

**Note:** Starting from 13.04, the Xubuntu images will not fit on standard CDs any more. This affects the Beta 1 images as well. To install Xubuntu, you will need other media such as a USB device or a DVD. The Xubuntu 13.04 Beta 1 image size is approximately 850 MB.

Xubuntu 13.04 is mostly a maintenance release, and there won't be too many new features. New features and bug fixes worth mentioning in Beta 1 include:

- Gnumeric and GIMP are reintroduced
- New version of Parole (0.5.0) is included
- Duplicate partitions are no longer shown on desktop or Thunar
- Some updates for the Greybird theme

Please note that the Beta 1 version is not suitable for production machines or anybody who doesn't wish to have an unstable system.

If you want to help Xubuntu testing the new release and are wondering how to help, please refer to our article on [Testing Raring](http://xubuntu.org/news/want-to-help-out-xubuntu-test-raring/ "Want to help out Xubuntu? Test Raring!"). This article will be appropriate for daily images as well as Beta 2 images which will be released later.

Those who are fine with having an unstable and promise to do backups before upgrading or installing can [download Xubuntu 13.04 Beta 1 here](http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/xubuntu/releases/13.04/beta-1).

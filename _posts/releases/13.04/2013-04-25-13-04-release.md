Notes
-----

Starting with 13.04, Xubuntu will have a support period of 9 months for the interim (non-LTS) releases. To read more about the background for the support window and maintenance changes, refer to the [Ubuntu Technical Board meeting minutes from 18th of March](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/TechnicalBoard/TeamReports/13/March).

Also starting with 13.04, the Xubuntu images will not fit on standard CDs. This is an effect of changing the target size to a 1GB USB device. To install Xubuntu 13.04 and beyond, you will need other media such as a USB device or a DVD. The Xubuntu 13.04 image size is approximately 800 MB.

***Another great milestone reached: Xubuntu 11.10 Oneiric Ocelot Alpha 2 released***

The second alpha release of Xubuntu 11.10 "Oneiric Ocelot" has arrived. The developers are working hard to make Xubuntu 11.10 one of the best Linux distributions yet. They are striving to ensure that everything will work for all users, and instead of many changes, are working to ensure the release is very stable and secure.

This is still a testing build designed for developers and is not suggested for anyone looking for a stable system.

*Changelog (since Alpha 1 - Xubuntu specific):*

- Kernel 3.0-rc5
- Xarchiver replaces FileRoller
- Leafpad replaces Mousepad
- LightDM replaces GDM

(Users *must* select a session when logging in the first time. If no session is selected, the user will see the Ubuntu wallpaper, and nothing else. In this case, go to a tty using Ctrl+Alt+F2, login, and type: `sudo service lightdm restart` Now the user can login again, and select the session.)

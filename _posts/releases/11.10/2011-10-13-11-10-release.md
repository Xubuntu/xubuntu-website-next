There are a few times when, through hard work and diligence, we get things right. The developers and contributors of Xubuntu 11.10 “Oneiric Ocelot” believe they have it right. They are proud to announce the release of Xubuntu 11.10, "Oneiric Ocelot". Through the outstanding efforts of all involved, this sleek and smooth release offered for your enjoyment and use.

Changes for this release include the following applications included by default: gThumb, pastebinit, and onboard. The team has also chosen to switch from GDM to LightDM as the default display manager and from mousepad to leafpad as the default text editor.

We invite you to give this newest member of the Xubuntu family a spin. The Xubuntu Desktop CD can be used on either USB drives or burned to a CD. Either will allow you to try this fantastic distribution before you install it.

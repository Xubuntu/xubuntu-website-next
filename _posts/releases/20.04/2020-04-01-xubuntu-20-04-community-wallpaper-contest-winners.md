Note that the images listed above are resized for the website. For the full size images, make sure you have the package **xubuntu-community-wallpapers** installed. The package is installed by default in all new Xubuntu 20.04 installations.

With Beta Freeze now in effect, these wallpapers may take a little longer than usual to land in the daily images. Keep a look out!

The Xubuntu team is glad to announce the immediate release of Xubuntu 12.10 Beta 2!

Along with new features and completely new looks, Beta 2 comes with other changes too: the Xubuntu team has decided to drop the alternate images at least for 12.10 due to the lack of manpower.

New features include:

- Updated artwork, including new wallpaper, documentation looks and updates to LightDM, Greybird and Ubiquity slideshow
- [Completely reviewed and rewritten offline documentation](http://xubuntu.org/news/offline-documentation-rewritten-for-12-10/ "Offline documentation rewritten for 12.10")
- New versions of Catfish and Parole

Notable bug fixes include:

- ISO now fits on a standard 700M CD
- No more window traces or "black on black" in installer

Known issues:

- The messaging indicator is not available for 12.10
- Duplicated partitions might be shown at Thunar sidebar and desktop

You may have noticed in the [release announcement](https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-release/2012-September/001883.html) for Beta 1 today from Kate Stewart this line:

> "With Ubuntu 12.10, Kubuntu, Edubuntu, Lubuntu, and Ubuntu Studio also reached Beta 1 status today. These images, along with Xubuntu will continue to have daily updates for the remainder of the release."

You read right, Xubuntu didn't release a Beta 1 this time around but we are continuing to work on our daily builds.

Currently we're working to get the image to fit on a single CD, fix up some visual regressions and there are a few outstanding bugs that we really want to tackle. We putting all our effort into getting this all completed so we can have have a great Beta 2 release!

If you download one of the daily images, you will notice new features, including:

- Updated artwork, including new wallpaper, documentation looks and updates to LightDM, Greybird and Ubiquity slideshow
- New versions of Catfish and Parole.

A few days after we welcomed Vivid Vervet 15.04 as the latest stable version, we see the oldest of our LTS versions go EOL. Xubuntu 12.04 "Precise Pangolin" had a three-year support cycle which concluded on April 26.

While it will continue to receive updates from the repository, we will no longer be providing any Xubuntu support for packages. Packages provided via Xubuntu-owned PPAs will also be discontinued.

All users are advised to upgrade their installation to the current LTS, Xubuntu 14.04 "Trusty Tahr". This version will continue to receive support from Xubuntu until April 2017. See our article for [5 things to do after upgrading from 12.04 to 14.04.](http://xubuntu.org/news/5-things-to-do-after-upgrading-from-12-04-to-14-04/)

Please reach out to us via one of our various [support channels](http://xubuntu.org/help/) if you need assistance upgrading.

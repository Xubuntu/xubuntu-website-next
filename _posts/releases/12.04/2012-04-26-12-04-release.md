In addition, you can stick a window (making it appear in all workspaces) with **Alt F8**. The shortcuts for moving and resizing windows have been removed in favor of more powerful mouse gestures. Naturally, if you need these shortcuts, you can enable them from the Settings Manager.

- **Super 1** for Gmusicbrowser
- **Super 2** for Pidgin
- **Super 3** for Abiword
- **Super 4** for Gnumeric

Known issues
------------

### Problems with keyboard shortcuts after upgrading

There is a change in how the shortcuts are handled, which will render all shortcuts with the *Control* key ususable on upgrade. To fix this, you need to update all your current shortcuts with Control: In Settings Manager » Keyboard » tab Application shortcuts, double click on the Shortcut column where it reads `<Control>` and press the (same) key combination. This will change the part `<Control>` to `<Primary>` and the shortcut will work again. The other option is to revert the keyboard shortcut settings back to defaults and readd your custom shortcuts.

Some users might experience problems with any other keyboard shortcuts as well. To fix this, you need to revert the keyboard shortcut settings back to defaults and readd your custom shortcuts.

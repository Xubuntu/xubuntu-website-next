The Xubuntu team is happy to announce the immediate release of Xubuntu 21.04.

Xubuntu 21.04, codenamed **Hirsute Hippo**, is a regular release and will be supported for 9 months, until January 2022. If you need a stable environment with longer support time we recommend that you use [Xubuntu 20.04 LTS](https://xubuntu.org/release/20-04/) instead.

The **final release images** are available as torrents and direct downloads from [xubuntu.org/download/](https://xubuntu.org/download/).

As the main server might be busy in the first few days after the release, we recommend using the torrents if possible.

**Xubuntu Core**, our minimal ISO edition, is available to download from [unit193.net/xubuntu/core/](https://unit193.net/xubuntu/core/) \[[torrent](https://unit193.net/xubuntu/core/pending/xubuntu-21.04-core-amd64.iso.torrent), [magnet](magnet:?xt=urn:btih:ca4784dadc291db154f2dc6806aad96140bb83f3&tr=udp://tracker.unit193.net:6969&tr=udp://tracker.opentrackr.org:1337/announce&dn=xubuntu-21.04-core-amd64.iso)\]. Find out more about Xubuntu Core [here](https://unit193.net/xubuntu/).

We'd like to thank everybody who contributed to this release of Xubuntu!

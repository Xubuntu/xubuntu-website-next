It is now possible to order *free Xubuntu CDs* (see the [Get Xubuntu](http://xubuntu.org/get#quickship)-page). These CDs are generously provided free of charge by [On-Disk.com](http://on-disk.com/) as part of their [Quick Ship free disc service](http://on-disk.com/cms/index.php?wiki=Quick_Ship_Free_Disc_Service), providing an alternative to [Ubuntu's ShipIt service](http://shipit.ubuntu.com/) which does not provide Xubuntu. This means potential users only have to pay shipping costs, avoiding having to download Xubuntu over a slow internet connection.

This entails an independent third party service, not run by Canonical nor the Xubuntu developers.

To celebrate **Xubuntu's tenth birthday\***, the Xubuntu team is glad to announce a new campaign and competition!

We're looking for your most memorable and fun Xubuntu story. In order to participate, submit the story to xubuntu-contacts@lists.ubuntu.com. Or you may share an image (photo, drawing, painting, etc) to Elizabeth K. Joseph &lt;<lyz@ubuntu.com>&gt; and Pasi Lallinaho &lt;<pasi@shimmerproject.org>&gt;, please restrict your file size to a maximum of 5M.

For example, have you shared Xubuntu with a friend or family member, and had them react in a memorable way? Or have you created Xubuntu-themed cookies, cakes or artwork? No story or experience is too simple to share and don't be restricted by these examples, surprise us!

Bonus: Share it on Twitter and hashtag it with #LoveXubuntu and during the competition, the Xubuntu team will retweet a posts on the [Twitter account for Xubuntu](https://twitter.com/Xubuntu). Additionally, we encourage to share your stories all over the social media!

At the end of the competition, we will select 5 finalists. All finalists will receive a set of Xubuntu stickers from [UnixStickers](http://www.unixstickers.com/collections/xubuntu)! We will pick 2 winners from the finalists who will also receive a Xubuntu t-shirt! We will be in touch with the finalists and winners after the contest has ended to check their address details and preferred t-shirt size and color (for winners).

The first point release for 18.04 Bionic Beaver has now been released.

As usual, this point release includes many updates, and updated installation media has been provided so that fewer updates will need to be downloaded after installation. These include security updates and corrections for other high-impact bugs, with a focus on maintaining stability and compatibility with Ubuntu 18.04 LTS.

The **point release images** are available as torrents immediately from the links below.

> The images are also available as direct downloads from [xubuntu.org/getxubuntu/](https://xubuntu.org/getxubuntu/). As the main server and mirrors might be busy for the first few days after the release, we recommend using the torrents if possible.

The Xubuntu team are happy to announce the results of the 18.04 community wallpaper contest!

We want to send out a huge thanks to every contestant; last time we had 92 submissions but now you all made us work much harder in picking the best ones out with a total of **162 submissions**! Great work! All of the submissions are browsable on the [18.04 contest page at contest.xubuntu.org](https://contest.xubuntu.org/wallpaper_contest/xubuntu-18-04-community-wallpaper-contest/?action=view).

Without further ado, here are the winners:

Note that the images listed above are resized for the website. For the full size images (up to 4K resolution!), make sure you have the package **xubuntu-community-wallpapers** installed. The package is installed by default in all new Xubuntu 18.04 installations.

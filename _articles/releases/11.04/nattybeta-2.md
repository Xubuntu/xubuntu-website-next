The second and final beta release of Xubuntu 11.04 "Natty Narwhal" has arrived. This is a testing build designed for testers and developers and is **not suggested for anyone looking for a stable system**. This beta replaces the traditional Release Candidate - the stable version for end-users will be released **April 28th 2011**, so these last two weeks of testing are of utmost importance for a stable release.

[Visit the download page](http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/xubuntu/releases/11.04/beta-2/) to give it a try. Be sure to report your testing results to help the Xubuntu developers - see [the ISO testing tracker](http://iso.qa.ubuntu.com/qatracker/build/xubuntu/all). [Bugs can be reported in Launchpad](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+filebug/).

If you are looking for [support](http://xubuntu.org/help), please see the #ubuntu+1 or #xubuntu IRC channels on irc.freenode.net.

Before testing this release, make sure to review the [release notes](http://www.ubuntu.com/testing/natty/beta) (specifically [the section on Xubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com/testing/natty/beta#Xubuntu)).

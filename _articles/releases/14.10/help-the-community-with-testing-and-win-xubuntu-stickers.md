Manual testing of the development version is an important part of the development cycle. The goal of manual testing is to find bugs that have been introduced during the cycle.

Finding these gives developers the opportunity to fix issues before the release. The sooner they are found, the bigger the possibility is that the bugs are fixed before regular users see them on their desktop. Without manual testers, our releases would be buggy. All that being said, **we need your help doing manual testing**.

Unfortunately, manual testing can often be a tedious and thankless job for the contributors who are doing the testing and bug reporting for the community. This cycle we're hoping to change that up a bit.

**We will be giving out** 7 [Xubuntu Sticker Bundles](http://www.unixstickers.com/stickers/linux_os_distribution_stickers/xubuntu-stickers-bundle) from now through April to selected top testers on the following schedule:

<table><thead><tr><th>Timespan</th><th>Admissible test reports</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>**February**</td><td>Test reports from start of cycle to 28th February</td></tr><tr><td>**Beta 1**</td><td>Tests reported during the milestone</td></tr><tr><td>**March**</td><td>Test reports from 1st March to 31st March</td></tr><tr><td>**Final Beta**</td><td>Tests reported during the milestone</td></tr><tr><td>**April**</td><td>Test reports from 1st April to 23rd April (end of the cycle)</td></tr><tr><td>**Final Release**</td><td>Tests reported during milestone</td></tr><tr><td>**Cycle**</td><td>Tests reported during the whole Vivid Vervet cycle</td></tr></tbody></table>

Depending on the success of this initiative we'll look into adding Xubuntu t-shirts and Ubuntu books to the program during the LTS cycle leading up to April 2016.

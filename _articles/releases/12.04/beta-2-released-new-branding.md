Our new branding
----------------

Along with the Beta 2 release of Xubuntu, we are proudly presenting our new branding, including a brand new and shiny logo, refreshed website looks and the few-days-old wallpaper for Precise. Our website also includes a page for [Xubuntu marketing resources](http://xubuntu.org/marketingresources/ "Marketing Resources"), including PNG and SVG versions of the new logo as well as some shiny, new web banners for public use.

### Without further babble, our new logo in all its glory

The new logo has a more condensed look and features a more saturated blue. To avoid being superfluous on blue, the logotype is printed on dark grey. It can also be easily replaced with white on darker backgrounds.

The picmark is still based on the [Xfce](http://xfce.org/) mouse, but it's more simplified and designed to work better in different contexts and sizes. While the picmark has lost some similarity with the Xfce mouse, reducing the complexity is a logical step from the last logo change.

### Xubuntu Precise wallpaper: a better experience for dual-head users

The new wallpaper consists of two parts to give dual-head users a better experience with default wallpapers for once. Here's the wallpaper in one, wide piece.

As some of you notice, the wallpaper has lots of elements previously seen on the Xubuntu wallpapers. That's right, it's intentional. Time to give some homage for the old times. We don't want to go too rusty or dusty, so there's some nice green stuff in, too.

The right side of the wallpaper with the flying bird will be the default wallpaper. If you don't like birds, rather just watch a more plain wallpaper, need to set a wallpaper to the other monitor too or just for fun: we encourage you to try out the left side too!

There's no certainty that we will keep on providing these wide wallpapers in the future releases, so starting from now is the right time to give feedback. Do you love it? Do you hate it? Should every operating system provide such wallpapers? Should we stick to providing one wallpaper only to keep the decision-making to a minimum? Express your thoughts at the [Xubuntu-devel mailing list](https://lists.ubuntu.com/mailman/listinfo/xubuntu-devel) or the [\#xubuntu-devel IRC channel](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=xubuntu-devel&nick=xubuntu...&prompt=1) on Freenode.

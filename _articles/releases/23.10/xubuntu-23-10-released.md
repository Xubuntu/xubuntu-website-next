With a focus on stability, memory management, and hardware support, Xubuntu 23.10 should perform well on your device. Enjoy frictionless bluetooth headphone connections and out-of-the-box touchpad support. Read Sean's [*What's New in Xubuntu 23.10*](https://blog.bluesabre.org/2023/10/10/whats-new-in-xubuntu-23-10/) post for an in-depth review of the latest updates.

The **final release images** for **Xubuntu Desktop** and **Xubuntu Minimal** are available as torrents and direct downloads from [xubuntu.org/download/](https://xubuntu.org/download/).

As the main server might be busy in the first few days after the release, we recommend using the torrents if possible.

Weâ€™d like to thank everybody who contributed to this release of Xubuntu!

Highlights and Known Issues
---------------------------

### Highlights

- Improved hardware support for **bluetooth headphones** and **touchpads**
- **Color emoji** is now included and supported in Firefox, Thunderbird, and newer Gtk-based apps
- Significantly improved **screensaver** integration and stability

### Known Issues

- The shutdown prompt may not be displayed at the end of the installation. Instead you might just see a Xubuntu logo, a black screen with an underscore in the upper left hand corner, or just a black screen. Press Enter and the system will reboot into the installed environment. (LP: [\#1944519](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu-release-notes/+bug/1944519))
- Xorg crashes and the user is logged out after logging in or switching users on some virtual machines, including GNOME Boxes. (LP: #[1861609](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/xorg-server/+bug/1861609))
- You may experience choppy audio or poor system performance while playing audio, but only in some virtual machines (observed in VMware and VirtualBox)

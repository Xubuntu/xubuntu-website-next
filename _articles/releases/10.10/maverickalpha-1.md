The first alpha release of Xubuntu 10.10 "Maverick Meerkat" has arrived. This is a testing build designed for developers and is **not suggested for anyone looking for a stable system**.

[Visit the download page](http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/xubuntu/releases/10.10/alpha-1/) to give it a try. Be sure to report your testing results to help the Xubuntu developers - see [the ISO testing tracker](http://iso.qa.ubuntu.com/qatracker/build/xubuntu/all), [Bugs can be reported in Launchpad](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+filebug/).

If you are looking for [support](/help)), please see the #ubuntu+1 or #xubuntu IRC channels on irc.freenode.net.

Before testing this release, make sure to review the [release notes](http://www.ubuntu.com/testing/maverick/alpha1). It is particularly useful to take note of the following known issue:

> When installing Xubuntu, the systray appears in the middle of the screen, with three icons flashing constantly. This prevents the installation from the live environment, and makes the desktop pretty much unusable after any installation completes. There is a workaround to this issue described in the [bug report (586012)](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/586012).

The Xubuntu team is happy to announce the immediate release of Xubuntu 22.10.

Xubuntu 22.10, codenamed **Kinetic Kudu**, is a regular release and will be supported for 9 months, until July 2023.

The "bleeding edge" Xfce 4.17 components are included as an early preview to the upcoming Xfce 4.18, expected later this year. You'll find that Xfce 4.17 includes many new features and usability improvements while using Xubuntu 22.10. While we've tested each component shipped in Xubuntu, new bugs and regressions are expected. Please be sure to report any bugs you find.

The **final release images** are available as torrents and direct downloads from [xubuntu.org/download/](https://xubuntu.org/download/).

As the main server might be busy in the first few days after the release, we recommend using the torrents if possible.

**Xubuntu Core**, our minimal ISO edition, is available to download from [unit193.net/xubuntu/core/](https://unit193.net/xubuntu/core/) \[[torrent](http://unit193.net/xubuntu/core/xubuntu-22.10-core-amd64.iso.torrent)\]. Find out more about Xubuntu Core [here](https://unit193.net/xubuntu/).

Weâ€™d like to thank everybody who contributed to this release of Xubuntu!

Highlights and Known Issues
---------------------------

### Highlights

- **Mousepad 0.5.10**, our text editor, introduces search history and automatic reloading of files modified externally.
- **Thunar 4.17.9**, the Xfce file manager, now includes built-in, recursive file search. If you need more advanced search parameters, Catfish is a click away.
- **Xfce PulseAudio Plugin 0.4.5** now displays an indicator when an application is recording audio. The microphone icon is displayed next to the existing audio level icon.

### Known Issues

- The shutdown prompt may not be displayed at the end of the installation. Instead you might just see a Xubuntu logo, a black screen with an underscore in the upper left hand corner, or just a black screen. Press Enter and the system will reboot into the installed environment. (LP: [\#1944519](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu-release-notes/+bug/1944519))

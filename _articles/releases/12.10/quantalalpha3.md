The Xubuntu team is proud to announce the Alpha3 release of Xubuntu 12.10, Quantal Quetzal!

We don't have any major changes from the Alpha2, but there are a few known issues you should be aware of:

- There are no alternate images for this release
- The image is still oversized for 700M CDs (see related bugs: [1028486](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1028486), [1029552](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1029552)), please use a USB stick, DVD or other method for installing these oversized images
- All applications using Gtk3 currently have some mismatched colors in menus and buttons because of a bug in the Unico engine ([1016713](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1016713)). A fix has been applied upstream but has not yet made it to Xubuntu.
- The installer locks when attempting to do the "Install Xubuntu 12.10 alongside..." auto-resize ([1027461](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1027461)), manual method for editing partitions and resizing works

The Xubuntu team is happy to announce the immediate release of Xubuntu 20.10!

Xubuntu 20.10, codenamed **Groovy Gorilla**, is a regular release and will be supported for 9 months, until July 2021. If you need a stable environment with longer support time we recommend that you use [Xubuntu 20.04 LTS](https://xubuntu.org/release/20-04/) instead.

The **final release images** are available as torrents and direct downloads from [xubuntu.org/download/](https://xubuntu.org/download/).

As the main server might be busy in the first few days after the release, we recommend using the torrents if possible.

**Xubuntu Core**, our minimal installation option, is available to download from [unit193.net/xubuntu/core/](https://unit193.net/xubuntu/core/) \[[torrent](http://unit193.net/xubuntu/core/xubuntu-20.04-core-amd64.iso.torrent), [magnet](magnet:?xt=urn:btih:11b377a1c8b9274f4103f5eee23cb659c3acf1ce&dn=xubuntu-20.04-core-amd64.iso&tr=udp%3a%2f%2ftracker.unit193.net%3a6969&tr=udp%3a%2f%2ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3a6969)\]. Find out more about Xubuntu Core [here](https://unit193.net/xubuntu/).

We'd like to thank everybody who contributed to this release of Xubuntu!

Highlights and Known Issues
---------------------------

### Highlights

- **GitHub:** At the beginning of this cycle, we transitioned all of our codebases to a single location to make getting started easier for new contributors. Check out the new [Xubuntu GitHub](https://github.com/xubuntu)!
- **Transifex:** We've made it easier than ever to contribute translations to Xubuntu! [Transifex](https://www.transifex.com/xubuntu/public/) brings all of our projects together in a single place, and removes various barriers to contributing.
- **Documentation:** A small team of new and past contributors joined together this cycle to refresh our documentation. Every chapter received significant updates, and will soon become available.

### Known Issues

- Users with AMD graphics may still experience [significant graphical issues](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/xserver-xorg-video-amdgpu/+bug/1873895). Since the release of 20.04, this issue has been found to be more widespread and also affects MATE users.

For more obscure known issues, information on affecting bugs, bug fixes, and a list of new package versions, please refer to the [Xubuntu Release Notes](https://wiki.xubuntu.org/releases/20.10/release-notes).

The main [Ubuntu Release Notes](https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/groovy-gorilla-release-notes/15533) cover both many of the other packages we carry and more generic issues.

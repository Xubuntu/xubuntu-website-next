The Xubuntu team is happy to announce the immediate release of Xubuntu 18.10!

Xubuntu 18.10 is a regular release and will be supported for 9 months, until July 2019. If you need a stable environment with longer support time, we recommend that you use [Xubuntu 18.04 LTS](https://xubuntu.org/release/18-04/) instead.

The **final release images** are available as torrents and direct downloads from [xubuntu.org/getxubuntu/](https://xubuntu.org/getxubuntu/)

As the main server might be busy in the first few days after the release, we recommend using the torrents if possible.

Weâ€™d like to thank everybody who contributed to this release of Xubuntu!

Highlights and Known Issues
---------------------------

### Highlights

- Several Xfce components and apps were updated to their 4.13 development releases, bringing us closer to a Gtk+3-only desktop
- elementary Xfce Icon Theme 0.13 with the manila folder icons as seen in the upstream elementary icon theme
- Greybird 3.22.9, which improves the look and feel of our window manager, alt-tab dialog, Chromium, and even pavucontrol
- A new default wallpaper featuring a gentle purple tone that greatly complements our Gtk+ and icon themes

### Known Issues

- At times the panel could show 2 network icons, this appears to be a race condition which we have not been able to rectify in time for release
- In the settings Manager, the mouse fails to scroll apps in settings manager (GTK+ 3 regression)

For more obscure known issues, information on affecting bugs, bug fixes, and a list of new package versions, please refer to the [Xubuntu Release Notes](http://wiki.xubuntu.org/releases/18.10/release-notes "Xubuntu 18.10 Release Notes").

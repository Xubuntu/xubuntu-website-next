The Xubuntu team is pleased to announce the immediate release of Xubuntu 16.10. Xubuntu 16.10 is a normal release and will be supported for 9 months.

This release has seen little visible change since April's 16.04, however much has been done towards supplying Xubuntu with Xfce packages built with GTK3, including the porting of many plugins and Xfce Terminal to GTK3. Those GTK3 ports can, if one wishes to test them, be installed from one of the team's [development PPAs](https://launchpad.net/~xubuntu-dev/+archive/ubuntu/xfce4-gtk3?)

The **final release images** are available as Torrents and direct downloads from <http://xubuntu.org/getxubuntu/>

As the main server will be very busy in the first few days after release, we recommend using the Torrents wherever possible.

### Known Issues

- Thunar is still the subject of a few bugs, though they all appear to revolve around similar issues. A further patch has been applied since 16.04.
- On some hardware the password is sometimes required twice when returning from suspend.

For more information on affecting bugs please refer to the [Release Notes](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/YakketyYak/FinalRelease/Xubuntu "Xubuntu 16.10 Release Notes").

Thanks to all who have contributed to Xubuntu, not least those who test for us when called upon, and generally *anyone* can do that for us all. We will name you all in time – you deserve one last mention. Thank you on behalf of all installing Xubuntu – you all rock!

In anticipation of the Xubuntu 16.04 LTS release, the Xubuntu team has prepared some treats for the blog to make the countdown even more enjoyable and exciting! Starting from this week, we will publish articles in *two* different article series. Here's what's waiting for you!

My media manager
----------------

As announced before, Xubuntu 16.04 LTS will not come with a default media manager. In this series some of the Xubuntu team members talk about a few of their favorite media players. Later in the series we discuss some of the cloud services the team members use as well as other media manager options that are available in the Ubuntu repositories.

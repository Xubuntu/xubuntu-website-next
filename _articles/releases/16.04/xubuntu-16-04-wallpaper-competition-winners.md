Today, the Xubuntu team are happy to announce the results of the 16.04 wallpaper competition in preparation for the 16.04 release only a few days from now!

Before we go into the results, we want to thank everyone who contributed to the competition! In total we had 92 submissions, which is over 10% more than for the 14.04 competition. Great work!

While we originally announced that we would be picking 6 winners, we eventually decided to pick a total of 10 winners. With many wallpapers tied on votes, we preferred to have more winners rather than trying to cut down the number to 6 exactly.

Without further ado, here's the winners in alphabetical order:

Highlights and Known Issues
---------------------------

### Highlights

Xubuntu now uses Xfce 4.12, which was released on February 28. The new release has brought both some new features and many bug fixes over the old 4.10/4.11 components. For a complete changelog for Xfce 4.12, see the [4.12 changelog on Xfce.org](http://xfce.org/download/changelogs/4.12 "Xfce 4.12 Changelog").

In addition to the new Xfce release, the 15.04 release has the following highlights:

- New/Updated Xubuntu Light/Dark colorschemes in Mousepad, Terminal
- Mousepad colorscheme set to Xubuntu Light by default
- Better appearance for QT applications out of the box (default to GTK theme)
- Redundant File Manager (Settings) menu entry removed

### Known Issues

When upgrading, the notes plugin is removed from the panel (Bug [1446598](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/xfce4-notes-plugin/+bug/1446598)) To work around this, simply add the notes plugin back to the panel. Your data is kept intact.

**Currently installing is only functioning correctly from the livesession install icon.**

- From either the boot screen OR the try/install dialogue - directly installing has windows created offscreen, this can be either the first install option screen, or where that works - the final Installation Complete dialogue goes offscreen. ([1425690](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/ubiquity/+bug/1425690))
- It is possible to move the *offscreen* windows, ensure that ubiqity is focused (alt+tab) then with alt+space+m and then Move the offscreen dialogues can be moved so they are visible.
- If you boot to *Try* from the boot screen or from the Try/Install dialogue - tests have shown that these options function correctly.

The Xubuntu team is happy to announce the immediate release of Xubuntu 19.04!

Xubuntu 19.04 is a regular release and will be supported for 9 months, until January 2020. If you need a stable environment with longer support time, we recommend that you use [Xubuntu 18.04 LTS](https://xubuntu.org/release/18-04/) instead.

The **final release images** are available as torrents and direct downloads from [xubuntu.org/getxubuntu/](https://xubuntu.org/getxubuntu/)

As the main server might be busy in the first few days after the release, we recommend using the torrents if possible.

Weâ€™d like to thank everybody who contributed to this release of Xubuntu!

Highlights and Known Issues
---------------------------

### Highlights

- Xubuntu 19.04 features a wide range of bug fixes for issues identified in previous releases, many of which have already been backported to the stable releases.
- AptURL, The GIMP, and LibreOffice Impress have been included to provide a more complete and user-friendly desktop experience.
- New keyboard shortcuts make it easier and faster to get work done. **Shift + Print Screen** will capture a screenshot for a specified region. Press **F4** in Thunar to open a terminal window in the current path, or press **Ctrl + Shift + F** to search for files.
- Many Xfce 4.13 components have been added or updated, providing an updated snapshot of Xfce 4.14 development.

### Known Issues

- If more than one instance of the Xfce Pulseaudio Plugin is added to the panel, volume notifications will be duplicated.
- Tooltips can become unresponsive in the Xfce Task Manager. Usually a bit of movement will cause the tooltip to fade away.

For more obscure known issues, information on affecting bugs, bug fixes, and a list of new package versions, please refer to the [Xubuntu Release Notes](http://wiki.xubuntu.org/releases/19.04/release-notes).

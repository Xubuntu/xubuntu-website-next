*In this series the Xubuntu team present some of the smaller details in Xubuntu to help you use your system more efficiently. Several of the features covered in this series are new for those who will be upgrading from 14.04 LTS to 16.04 LTS. We will also cover some features that have been in Xubuntu for longer, for those that are completely new to the operating system.*

Xubuntu comes with some useful shortcut keys by default. Using these shortcut keys can help you be more efficient with your daily work. Of course you can always modify them or add your own. Here's how!

Default shortcuts
-----------------

For convenience, some default application can be launched with shortcuts that use the Super key (usually the "Windows" key) and a letter associated with the task (underlined):

- **Super+E** for the text <span style="text-decoration: underline;">e</span>ditor (Mousepad)
- **Super+F** for the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">f</span>ile manager (Thunar)
- **Super+M** for the e<span style="text-decoration: underline;">m</span>ail client (Thunderbird)
- **Super+T** for the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">t</span>erminal emulator (Xfce4 Terminal)
- **Super+W** for the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">w</span>eb browser (Firefox)

You can find all the application shortcut keys from **Menu → Settings Manager → Keyboard → tab Application Shortcuts**. You can also easily **Add** new shortcuts from this dialog.

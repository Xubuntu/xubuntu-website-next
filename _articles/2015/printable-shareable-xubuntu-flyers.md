During the Wily Werewolf development cycle, the Xubuntu Marketing team has completed work on flyers that can now be printed by anyone wishing to promote Xubuntu at conferences, global jams, release parties and other events.

Flyers can be printed at home or with any typical printing service. A successful trial run of 25 US letter-sized flyers was completed in August by our marketing lead:

Please note that while you are free to make your own version, we encourage you to contribute back to the official flyer so we can improve it for everybody! If you want to get involved with the next revision of the flyer, join #xubuntu-devel on Freenode or the [Xubuntu Development mailing list](https://lists.ubuntu.com/mailman/listinfo/xubuntu-devel) and let us know your thoughts!

If you are interested in translating the flyer, be in touch with us as well; we will help you with potential issues with the layouting and more and can promote the translated version on the website.

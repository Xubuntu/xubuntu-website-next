The Xubuntu team hears stories about how it is used in organizations all over the world. In this "Xubuntu at.." series of interviews, we seek to interview organizations who wish to share their stories. If your organization is using Xubuntu and you want to share what youâ€™re doing with us please contact Elizabeth K. Joseph at lyz@ubuntu.com to discuss details about your organization.
